# X-Compiler
This is an academic job compiler for X++ language.
We built using Modern C++, were it can be receive a .xpp file, and process the syntax rules.

Work requested in the compilers discipline at the computer engineering course.
This is a compiler for the X++ language described in the book "Como construir um Compilador Utilizando Ferramentas Java" by MÃ¡rcio Eduardo Delmaro.
Some changes were made to the language and the file used is found in this folder with the name "GramaticaX++".
To strat the project, we removed the left recursion from this grammar and the file with the removal can also be found in this folder with the name "GramaticaSemRecursao".
The work was made using C/C++, in this folder there are some tests and in the "INFOS" file you will find the names of the participants/collaborators and the command on how to execute the code.
